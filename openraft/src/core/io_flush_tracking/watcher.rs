/// I/O flush progress watch handles.
///
/// This struct maintains the receiving ends of watch channels that track I/O flush progress.
/// It provides three independent progress streams:
///
/// - **Log progress**: Tracks all I/O operations (both vote saves and log appends). Updated
///   whenever any data is flushed to storage.
///
/// - **Vote progress**: Tracks only vote changes. Updated when the vote value changes (new term or
///   leader), not on every log append.
///
/// - **Applied progress**: Tracks logs applied to the state machine. Updated when the last applied
///   log id advances.
///
/// The separation allows applications to efficiently wait for different kinds of progress:
/// - Use log progress to wait for specific log entries to be durable
/// - Use vote progress to wait for leadership changes to be persisted
