//! I/O flush progress tracking.
//!
//! This module provides watch-based notification channels for tracking when Raft I/O operations
//! (vote saves and log appends) are flushed to storage. It enables applications to:
//!
//! - Wait for specific log entries to be durably written
//! - Track vote changes across leader elections
//! - Ensure data persistence before responding to clients
//!
//! The tracking is based on monotonically increasing [`crate::raft_state::IOId`] values that
//! identify each I/O operation. When storage completes an operation, it notifies RaftCore, which
//! updates the progress channels.
